## Youtube will kill Oauth use Cookies instead
```
#!/bin/bash

# Path to the yt-dlp executable in the virtual environment
YTDLP_PATH="$HOME/yt-dlp/bin/yt-dlp"

# Use the yt-dlp executable with your arguments
$YTDLP_PATH --cookies $HOME/cookies.txt "$@"
```
Check: [how do i pass cookies to yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp) and [export YouTube cookies](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#exporting-youtube-cookies)

## Plugins?
**You do not need any plugins, but you can use them if you wish.** 
Most of them have hardcoded channels and paths, so you will need to adjust and place the .cs file into the Plugins folder.
alternatively you can also compile it to an dll.

#### Linux
Install the required dependencies:

~~ * on **Ubuntu**/**Debian**:  ~~
~~ Run `sudo apt-get install libopus-dev ffmpeg`~~ 
~~ * on **Arch Linux**:  ~~

Run
    ```
    sudo yum -y install epel-release
    sudo rpm -Uvh http://li.nux.ro/download/nux/dextop/el7/x86_64/nux-dextop-release-0-5.el7.nux.noarch.rpm
    sudo yum -y install ffmpeg opus-devel
	```

* **manually**:
    1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed
    1. Make the Opus script runnable with `chmod u+x InstallOpus.sh` and run it with `./InstallOpus.sh`
    1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-i686-static.tar.xz) or [64bit](https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-amd64-static.tar.xz) binary.
    1. Extract the ffmpeg archive with `tar -vxf ffmpeg-git-*XXbit*-static.tar.xz`
    1. Get the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-git-*DATE*-amd64-static/ffmpeg` and copy it into your TS3AudioBot folder.

#### Windows
1. Get the ffmpeg [32bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win32/static/ffmpeg-latest-win32-static.zip) or [64bit](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-latest-win64-static.zip) binary.
1. Open the archive and copy the ffmpeg binary from `ffmpeg-latest-winXX-static/bin/ffmpeg.exe` into your TS3AudioBot folder.

### Optional Dependencies
If the bot can't play some youtube videos it might be due to some embedding restrictions which are blocking this.  
You can install the [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) binary or source folder (and specify the path in the config) to try to bypass this.

### First time setup
1. Run the bot with `./start.sh` (Linux) or `TS3AudioBot.exe` (Windows) and follow the setup instructions.
1. (Optional) Close the bot and configure your `rights.toml` to your desires.
You can use the template rules as suggested in the automatically generated file,
or dive into the rights syntax [here](https://github.com/scheissegalo/TS3AudioBot/wiki/Rights).
Then start the bot again.
1. (Optional, but highly recommended for everything to work properly).
   - Create a privilege key for the ServerAdmin group (or a group which has equivalent rights).
   - Send the bot in a private message `!bot setup <privilege key>`.
1. Congratz, you're done! Enjoy listening to your favourite music, experimenting with the crazy command system or do whatever you whish to do ;).

### Building the WebInterface
1. Go with the console of your choice into the `./WebInterface` folder
1. Run `npm install` to restore or update all dependencies for this project

Why OSL-3.0:
- OSL allows you to link to our libraries without needing to disclose your own project, which might be useful if you want to use the TSLib as a library.
- If you create plugins you do not have to make them public like in GPL. (Although we would be happy if you shared them :)
- With OSL we want to allow you providing the TS3AB as a service (even commercially). We do not want the software to be sold but the service. We want this software to be free for everyone.
